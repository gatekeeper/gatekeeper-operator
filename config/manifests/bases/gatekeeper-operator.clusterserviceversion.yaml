    Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper enforces CRD-based policies.

    Every organization has policies. Some are essential to meet governance and
    legal requirements. Others help ensure adherence to best practices and
    institutional conventions. Attempting to ensure compliance manually would be
    error-prone and frustrating. Automating policy enforcement ensures
    consistency, lowers development latency through immediate feedback, and
    helps with agility by allowing developers to operate independently without
    sacrificing compliance.

    Kubernetes allows decoupling policy decisions from the inner workings of the
    API Server by means of [admission controller webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/), which are executed
    whenever a resource is created, updated or deleted. Gatekeeper is a
    validating and mutating webhook that enforces CRD-based policies executed
    by [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa), a policy
    engine for Cloud Native environments hosted
    by CNCF as a [graduated project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/open-policy-agent-opa/).

    In addition to the admission scenario, Gatekeeper's audit functionality
    allows administrators to see what resources are currently violating any
    given policy.

    Finally, Gatekeeper's engine is designed to be portable, allowing
    administrators to detect and reject non-compliant commits to an
    infrastructure-as-code system's source-of-truth, further strengthening
    compliance efforts and preventing bad state from slowing down the
    organization.

    Gatekeeper has the following functionality:
    * An extensible, parameterized policy library
    * Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka "constraints")
    * Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka "constraint templates")
    * Audit functionality

    For more information, see the [Gatekeeper documentation](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/).
